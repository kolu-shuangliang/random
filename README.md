## responsive-css ##
Trying to make some usefull css elements.

### Navbar ###
* Sticks to top.
* No JQuery required.
* Default and mobile view. Media query as 768px width.
* Logo/brand, single nested links, floats left/right.

Problems for now.
* Too many links push to second row. Have to manage them manually.
* If last link in float: right is nested then it's dropdown will clip to outside of window.

### Responsive grids ###
Tried to make this like bootstrap. Only did 1 - 4 grids

Grid widths are following.
1. 1
2. 1/2
3. 1/3, 2/3
4. 1/4, 2/4, 3/4
